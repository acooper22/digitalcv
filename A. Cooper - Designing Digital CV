            <h2> Ruth's Chris Steakhouse</h2>
<p>I had this exquisite meal from Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in Virginia as a birthday celebration/ spring break. I had crabcakes and mashed potatoes. Not the typical thing you'd order from a steak house. I love seafood, if there's seafood on any menu I'm going to order it. The crabcakes were clumpy and flavorful. According to the waitor, the mashed potatoes were made right before he brought them out to me. The plate and food were steaming hot. The mashed potatoes were so soft and creamy texture.</p>

        <h2>Alexis's Famous Breakfast inc. & Pretty Little Tacos</h2>
<p>In my opinion, I make THE BEST BREAKFAST! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, I try my best not to miss it. I believe I am an expert in breakfast foods. I make pancakes, sausage, bacon, eggs (fried and scrambled), grits, and more. I'm a southern girl so I LOVE grits! During our breaks throughout the school year, when I'm home I cook breakfast often for my family. In the photo below I made grits, eggs, and beef sausage, with a strawberry-banana smoothie I blended.

    <p>Over the Summer I traveled to Atlanta, Georgia with my family. We did numerous activities and ate at numerous restaurants. Truthfully, all the food I tried in Atlanta was so good. Though I never thought a taco, in particular, could be so tasty. In this picture, I ate chicken tacos from Pretty Little Tacos. It was topped with cilantro, onions, and a few of their seasonings. I had a side sauce and lime slices. Everything went so well together. Pretty Little Tacos is only in Atlanta, there are no other restaurants so it made me sad that it would probably be a while before I had them again. </p>

            <h2>Ice Cream with (Friend) Mia!</h2>
<p>Around the time of Valentine's day, a couple of friends and I went to Downtown-Burlington, NC to take some cute photos. After our photo sessions, we went to grab some ice cream. Mia and I sat outdoors in this ice cream shop and enjoyed our mint chocolate chip ice cream. </p>
