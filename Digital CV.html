        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p><span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold">Hello to everyone reading! I am Alexis Cooper. I am a young black female. I was born in March of 2003. I am 19 years old.</span></span></p>
           <h1>Professional Life:</h1>
    <p> <span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold">I am sophomore student at Elon University, listed on the Spring '22 President's List. I hope to have an internship within the next year. </span></span></p>
<a href= "https://www.elon.edu/AcademicAnnouncements/Print?AnnouncementID=98705"> Alexis named to President's List at Elon University </a>
    <p> <span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold">I've worked since I was 15 years old.  My first job was at a restaurant named 'Zesto's' which sold burgers, hotdogs, and icecream. I worked there for two years until it got shut down in 2020.
    I then worked at Krispy Kreme for a year until I graduated High School. I was seeking for higher pay, so that summer I quit Krispy Kreme and worked at Lowe's Home Improvement for 3 months.
    During Christmas/Winter break last year I worked seasonal (3 weeks) at Victoria Secret. This past summer I returned to Krispy Kreme and got a pay increase.</span></span> </p>
    <p><span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold">The most student involvement and student work I've done so far in my participation within Elon's Student Governmetn Association.
    In SGA I serve as one of the Sophomore (Class of 2025) senators. My overall job of as senator is to help facilitate student/faculty relations, to ensure that student concerns and needs are resolved,
    and to oversee student clubs and activities. </span></span></p>

        <h1>Personal Life:</h1>
        <p> <span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold">In my free time I like hanging out with friends, going to the movies, and shopping. I also enjoy working out, really only have time to go to the gym about 3 times a week because of school work, classes, and other organizations I'm involved in. </span></span></p>
        <p> <span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold">I am from Winston-Salem NC, roughly a 45-minute drive from Elon. I live with both my parents and brother, who is 21 years old. I also have my eldest brother who works and lives in South Carolina.</span></span></p>
        <img src="Pictures/IMG_0638.jpg" width="500"> 
        <p><span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold">I love traveling, especially with family! In these last few years I've been to Dominican-Republic, New York, Atlanta (GA), Miami (FL), and South Carolina to visit family. </span></span></p> 
        <p> <span style="color:#006266;font-weight:bold"> When I'm in a groovy mood, these are some of the songs I'll sing or dance to with my Mom. You can't go wrong with some Mary J. Blidge! </span></span></p>
